project: library

two approaches

todo

- add books to list > done
- return button to HIDE form and SHOW table > done
- add book to table (done)
- BUG: adding books to table twice, this is because of the Display Table function (done)
  - potential solutions
    - prevent dupes from being added into array 
    - create an array that adds each element in the form table, if a dupe exists we skip that iteration (works)
- BUG 
- styling
