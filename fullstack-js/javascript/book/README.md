project: library

two approaches

1. we can create the submit book form and hide it (initially)
so when we submit book we hide the original display list
then show again upon click (this is the move)

ok so let's break down the steps

1. populate book table with a single entry (hardcoded) 
2. create form to add books and return
   1. hide current table when that is occuring
   2. on submit make sure that book is being added to the table
      1. you can do this by remembering to add it to the myLibrary array
